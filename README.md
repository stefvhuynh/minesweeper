Minesweeper
===========

This is an implementation of [Minesweeper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) that can be played in the console. To play, type

```shell
ruby minesweeper.rb
```

You can specify the dimensions of the board. The default is set to a 9 x 9 board. Once the above command is run, the game will prompt the user for a board size.

You can also save and load games. Games are saved via [YAML](http://www.yaml.org).
